# Bible Translation

A modified version of the World English Bible (WEB) translation. This project uses the WEB translation as its foundation and introduces specific enhancements to improve verse alignment with other translations. The World English Bible is a Public Domain translation of the Holy Bible into modern English, and our modifications aim to make it even more accessible while maintaining its faithful rendering of biblical texts.

## Modifications from Original WEB
This repository contains modifications to the original WEB translation to improve verse alignment with other widely-used translations such as NASB1995 and ESV. These changes focus on:
- Standardizing verse ordering to match common Bible translation formats
- Adjusting text structure to facilitate parallel reading with other translations
- Aligning verse numbering with NASB 1995 versification while preserving the original WEB text content

For a detailed list of specific changes, including verse rearrangements and added verses from WEB footnotes, please see our [Translation Modifications Documentation](https://versewell.github.io/translation#translation-modifications).
